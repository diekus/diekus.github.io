            <p>👋 Hola! My name is Diego Gonz&aacute;lez. I am a Product Manager and Developer Advocate working for several years on the Web platform 🌐. I am currently involved with efforts around <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps">Progressive Web Apps</a> alongside the <a href="https://microsoftedgewelcome.microsoft.com/en-gb/">Microsoft Edge</a> team. I am also a co-editor of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/device-posture/">Device Posture API specification</a>, which explores giving the Web capabilities to adapt to cutting edge Dual Screen and Foldable devices 📱. In the past I have been known to be enthusiastic about <a href="https://immersiveweb.dev/">WebXR</a> and even further back in time I was a big nerd for stereoscopy on the Web. I've worked as a university teacher 👨‍🏫, software consultant 👨‍💻, and researcher 👨‍🔬 along the years.</p>
            <p>Here's a little bit more about me. I was born and raised in <a href="https://visitcostarica.com">Costa Rica 🌎</a>, and have lived in several countries 🌍. I have a PhD in Informatics 💻 and a couple of Master degrees. I like to take pictures as a hobby 📸, play a lot of videogames 🎮, love vector art 🖼 and have a weird obssesion with technology gadgets in general 🛰.</p></p>
            <p>I enjoy spreading the word about new open technology and guiding people to discover how it can help them in their tasks. I also enjoy public speaking, and helping shape the future of the Web platform. I am open for speaking opportunities and mentorship. If I can help you in any way, do drop me a line via any of the accounts listed below.</p>
